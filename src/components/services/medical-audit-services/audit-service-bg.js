        <p className="font-normal text-lg leading-9 text-center">
        When you outsource your claims audit to a renowned medical billing company such as MedsIT Nexus, we make the billing process easier by acting as a mediator between your specialties and an insurance company. Before sending claims to the insurance company, it is processed through the software where the automated rule engines are applied to identify mistakes that would lead to the denials. 
        
        But the MedsIT Nexus goes beyond claim scrubbing and uses our clearinghouse partnerâ€™s preferred scrubbing tool; this catches errors far better and faster than humans.

        Additionally, our automated claims scrubbing services ensure that medical professionals eliminate the technical complexities of the claims processing and spend maximum time in patient care to adhere to the state of law.
